# Application Usage
[Application Demo](https://youtu.be/wAbhc1If1gs)
First, make sure any existing readme's are deleted from the application before creating a new one. This is to ensure a new readme gets generated. Once everything in the installation has been installed continue by opening the terminal and typing node index.js <br>
<br>
Once that has been typed, answer each question thoroughly and when the final question is answered, a Readme will be generated and you can make minor adjustments from there like added media, gifs, images that help put your explanation of your project into more practical viewable terms but all styling will be done by the readme markdown generator.
